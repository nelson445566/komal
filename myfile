Monthly Highlights, March 2024
The CEO role is challenging, demanding, and important—particularly in today’s uniquely tough operating environment. But how are CEOs actually performing, and what can they do to reach their full potential? As we approach the second anniversary of the release of CEO Excellence, the best-selling book by McKinsey’s Carolyn Dewar, Scott Keller, and Vikram Malhotra, we look at how CEOs can succeed across their leadership journey. Our first featured story explores early results from our proprietary CEO Excellence Assessment Tool, which offer insights into the key issues facing more than 100 CEOs who primarily lead companies headquartered in Asia across 17 major industries. Our second featured story dives into how CEOs can excel at every stage of their journey: preparing for the role, transitioning into the role, navigating the middle years, and transitioning out of the role. Other highlights in this month’s issue include the following topics:

•

﻿harnessing the power of generative AI in energy and materials
